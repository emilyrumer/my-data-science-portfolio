This is a repository demonstrating examples of my analytical work. 







The [Transport Project Notebook](transport-project.ipynb) contains the code, analysis outputs and interpretations to a research project which investigates the relationship between transport and income in Norfolk and West Yorkshire. Research questions answered within this project include:
   1. Is there a difference in the average income in Norfolk and West Yorkshire?
   2. How does the Rural/Urban Classification of Norfolk and West Yorkshire MSOAs differ?
   3. Is there a difference in the transport methods that people use to travel to work in Norfolk and West Yorkshire?
   4. Can income be explained by transport methods in Norfolk and West Yorkshire?


The [Geodemographic Classifier](geodemographic-classifier.ipynb) notebook contains the process of building a classifier in both Liverpool and Bradford using census data. This was my contribution of a group project, whereby the task was to assess whether high streets served the surrounding populations.
