This is a repository demonstrating a selection of my data science and analytics work. 

The [Undergraduate Dissertation](undergraduate-dissertation) folder contains the R script, and written output to my BSc Criminal Justice and Criminology (with quantitative research methods) dissertation. The study is titled: 'An Empirical Study into the Relationship Between Mental Wellbeing and Cell-Sharing in Male Prisons in England and Wales', and is an analysis of the HMIP Prisoner Survey 2022/23. Logistic regression is used to reach the conclusion that prisoners in individual cells are more likely to experience mental health problems than those in shared-cells.

The [Transport Project Notebook](transport-project.ipynb) contains the code, analysis outputs and interpretations to a research project which investigates the relationship between transport and income in Norfolk and West Yorkshire. Research questions answered within this project include:
   1. Is there a difference in the average income in Norfolk and West Yorkshire?
   2. How does the Rural/Urban Classification of Norfolk and West Yorkshire MSOAs differ?
   3. Is there a difference in the transport methods that people use to travel to work in Norfolk and West Yorkshire?
   4. Can income be explained by transport methods in Norfolk and West Yorkshire?


The [Geodemographic Classifier](geodemographic-classifier.ipynb) notebook contains the process of building a classifier in both Liverpool and Bradford using census data. This was my contribution of a group project, whereby the task was to assess whether high streets served the surrounding populations.

The [Bathing Water Quality OLS Regression File](bathingwaterquality-OLSregression.ipynb) is my contribution in a group analysis of bathing water. My section involved the statistical exploration of the predictive variables of certain bacterias in the water. This analysis was conducted by building OLS linear regression models. The regression results were later incorporated into a GUI application.
