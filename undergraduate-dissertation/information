The study is titled: 'An Empirical Study into the Relationship Between Mental Wellbeing and Cell-Sharing in Male Prisons in England and Wales'.

This is the abstract to the study: 
This dissertation seeks to analyse if there is a relationship between cell-sharing and mental wellbeing in the male adult prisoner population in England and Wales. 
5981 respondents to HM Inspectorate of Prisons’ 2022/23 Survey represent this population. Quantitative research methods are used in this study to understand this 
relationship, through statistical analysis and logistic regression of the cross-sectional cohort. The exploration of mental wellbeing within prisons will argue that 
progression is needed in the prison system, as overcrowding has put a strain on staff and resources, removing the opportunity of rehabilitation for many prisoners. 
This study finds that prisoners in individual cells are more likely to experience mental health problems. Demographic and contextual factors are also found to 
affect this relationship. Those found to have the most significant impact on mental wellbeing are age; engagement in meaningful activity (such as education); 
feeling safe; illicit drug usage; and frequent visits from familial relations. This research reviews each of these factors, and how they may impact someone’s mental 
wellbeing, depending on their cell status. Theoretical models, such as dramaturgy, are used to explain that prisoners in shared cells have no opportunity to revert 
to their backstage self.
